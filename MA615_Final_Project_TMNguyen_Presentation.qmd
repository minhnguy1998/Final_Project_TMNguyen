# GDP Comparisons
- It appears that the TCI's GDP trend throughout the years is most similar to the Bahamas, making it a competitor to look out for. The values are close, however, it appears that the Bahamas generally has higher GDP per Capita overall than TCI. 
- TCI has much higher GDP per capita when compared to Cuba and the Dominican Republic.
However, Cuba and Dominican Republic appear to have similar GDP per Capita trends. 
Perhaps this could be due to the location. The Turks and Caicos and Bahamas are located
northeast compared to Cuba and Dominican Republic (southwest).

# Conclusion 

- TCI share similar government to the U.S (both originated from Britain)
- Its GDP per Capita is competitive compared to surrounding islands
- **SWOT:**
  - **Strengths:** high end beaches and resorts bring in tourism
  - **Weaknesses:** limited diversity of attractions (mainly sea activities)
  - **Opportunities:** The data-driven Market Intelligence Unit is utilizing data to 
                    place competitive edge for TCI over competitors
  - **Threats:** Vulnerable to natural disasters such as hurricanes
